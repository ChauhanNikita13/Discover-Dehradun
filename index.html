                <h3>Tapkeshwar Temple</h3>
                <p>Tapkeshwar Temple, also known as Tapkeshwar Mahadev Temple, is a temple in Dehradun dedicated to
                    Shiva. The temple is on the bank of the Tons River, built on top of a natural cave, which holds the
                    temple's main shivalinga.<br>The Tapkeshwar Temple is alleged to be 6,000 years old. It has a
                    natural shivalinga in the cave, which became a place of reverence for the local people.

                    It is also believed that this was used as a residence by Dronacharya, the teacher of the Pandavas
                    and Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata; the cave is called Drona Cave after him.
                    Dronacharya's wife Kalyani was unable to breastfeed their newborn son Ashwatthama. As Dronacharya
                    was unable to afford a cow or cow's milk, Ashwatthama prayed to Shiva, who then fed him milk
                    dripping from the shivalinga in the cave.</p>
