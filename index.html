            <h2>About Dehradun</h2>
            <p>
                Nested in the mountain ranges of the Himalaya, Dehradun is one of the oldest cities of India and is
                recently
                declared as the Provisional Capital of newly created Uttaranchal (Now Uttarakhand) State in the
                month of
                Nov’2000. Also known as the ‘Adobe of Drona’, Dehradun has always been an important center for
                Garhwal
                rulers which was captured by the British. <br><br>The headquarters of many National Institutes and
                Organizations
                like ONGC, Survey Of India, Forest Research Institute, Indian Institute of Petroleum etc are located
                in the
                city. Some of the premier educational and Training Institutes like Indian Miltary Academy,
                RIMC(Rashtriya
                Indian Military College), Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy(IGNFA), Lal Bahadur Shahstri
                National
                Academy of Administration(LBSNAA)etc are also there in Dehradun. <br><br>It is a favoured tourist
                destination as it
                attracts tourists, pilgrims and enthusiasts from various walks of life to its serene environs. Add
                to this
                the abundance of special Basmati rice, tea and leechi gardens which contribute in turning the city
                into a
                paradise.

                <br><br>The district is named after its chief city Dehra Dun. Dehra appears to be a collection of
                deras signifying a
                temporary abode or camp. During the reign of Aurangzeb, Ram Rai, Guru of the Udasi Sikhs on being
                ordered by
                the Mughal king to retire to the wilderness of the Dun, had pitched his tents here in what is now
                the
                Khurbura locality of the town and has also built a temple near Dhamawala. Around these two sites,
                grew up
                the town popularly known as Dehra. The term dun or doon means the low lands at the foot of a
                mountain range,
                and as the bulk of the district lies in such a terrain, it justified the dun part of the name.

                <br><br>Another derivation of the term dun is stated to be from Dronashram, hermitage of Guru
                Dronacharya of
                Mahabharata fame, who sojourned for a season in the village of Devara, situated near to Dehra to
                perform his
                devotions at a lonely spot.

                <p>Robber's Cave (locally known as Guchhu pani), located near Sahasradhara (thousand fold spring), is a

                    cave
                    has a highest fall of about 10 metres. <br>The cave got its name due to the popular belief that it
                    was once a hideout for robbers, hence the name 'Robber's Cave'. This adds a hint of mystery and
                    intrigue to the location, making it even more attractive to visitors.</p>

                <h3>Tapkeshwar Temple</h3>
                <p>Tapkeshwar Temple, also known as Tapkeshwar Mahadev Temple, is a temple in Dehradun dedicated to
                    Shiva. The temple is on the bank of the Tons River, built on top of a natural cave, which holds the
                    temple's main shivalinga.<br>The Tapkeshwar Temple is alleged to be 6,000 years old. It has a
                    natural shivalinga in the cave, which became a place of reverence for the local people.

                    It is also believed that this was used as a residence by Dronacharya, the teacher of the Pandavas
                    and Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata; the cave is called Drona Cave after him.
                    Dronacharya's wife Kalyani was unable to breastfeed their newborn son Ashwatthama. As Dronacharya
                    was unable to afford a cow or cow's milk, Ashwatthama prayed to Shiva, who then fed him milk
                    dripping from the shivalinga in the cave.</p>
